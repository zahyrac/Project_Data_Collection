      "The size of the restaurant was pretty deceiving, at first it looks tiny but it actually has 3 rooms available with a ton of space. The drinks were pretty good to my liking but to someone who prefers more alcohol it may seem watered down. Their oxtail tacos are REALLY GOOD, the only downside is there was still some pieces of bone left inside the taco from the oxtail. I ordered the Sweet Chili Shrimp and peas and rice. The shrimp was very wet drenched in the chili sauce while the peas and rice was very dry. Food could've overall been better but it's worth a try if you've never been here.\n",

      "Food had no flavor, the people working with the food had no mask no hair nets on them touching their clothing hair and then packing peoples food.  Also their food had no flavor whats so ever I had ordered Mac and Cheese, Sweet Chili wings, and Rasta pasta with chicken and shrimp just horrible. And then I tell them that my kid has a seafood allergy wbu they going to pack everything that has seafood right on top of the food that has the allergy and all the juices of the shrimp roti had leaked into the food so I couldn't give that food to my kid. Just very disappointed with this restaurant. Also why they said it's going to take 10-15 minutes but it took at least 45 to get our food and I had noticed two bags on the counter for a good while and then finally the server came to us and said your food is ready. Just very disappointed.\n",

      "I've been ordering from Code Red since they opened and as restaurants go, in the beginning things were good, but due to lack of professionalism or some comfortability the service and the food is declining. I ordered take out yesterday that took 50 minutes. While waiting to pick up the food my husband overheard conversations about nails and $500 hair units. I ordered a large order of chicken but it came in a medium container but I didn't complain. Then when we finally get our food home, there's this plastic in it. I thought it was the bone of the fish I ordered but it was in the side of garlic mashed potatoes. Do better Code Red. In the meantime you've lost a customer.\n",

      "First time going for a birthday dinner. The waitress had an attitude, service was slow. Drinks weren't good, only thing that was good was the music. Food not done well enough or burnt. We asked for napkins serval times and the waitress didn't want to give it to us. We wanted to place a food order which she told us to wait after she brought back drinks, which took 20 mins. The food was cold and unseasoned at all. Chicken raw, rice hard, lobster burnt with no meat. Just trifling\n",

      "I had the opportunity of trying this restaurant in the Bronx for the very first time and I had heard so many raving reviews about it, until I had to tried it for myself. This restaurant does not need any introduction, the flavor of their sauce, as my nephew would say was Bussin, it was amazing, absolutely amazing! With the liquor from the oxtails being so delicious, it made you want to eat everything on your plate. They give you more than enough rice and peas, I don't think they give you enough oxtails but the oxtails were delicious. They give you very little cabbage, but the main course was the rice and the liquor I would say. I highly recommend this restaurant, they really did the thing with the food. The customer service was very nice and I will try it again. I'm just said that the restaurant two blocks below it was not as good.\n",

      "So disappointed. I was there for lunch around 12:30pm on a Thursday. There were a total of 4 other guests in the entire space. You would think that it would be easy to deliver decent service & food but nope. We ordered the crab cake appetizer that comes with corn salsa. The corn salsa being the deciding factor in ordering the dish. It took 20 minutes to come out and when it does the server sets down the plate and says, \"sorry but we ran out of corn salsa so the chef substituted with aioli sauce. I hope that's ok\" and walked away! The crab cakes had this sauce drizzled ALL over them. What chef takes the liberty to just do that. The other person in my party detests sauces and cannot eat them. And for the server to just walk away like here you go...unacceptable. I didn't say anything quite frankly bc the person with me was of another race and I didn't want to down talk a black establish in front of them. I ate the burned crab cakes drizzled in sauce. 20 minutes later my main course of crab legs, shrimp, corn, and potato comes out. Absolutely awful. When I tell you the potato was so hard and under cooked, I couldn't even slice into it. It was literally like a raw potato! The corn on the cob piece was completely cold and dry. It looked the way cob looks when you leave it out overnight. Again, unacceptable. The shrimp was good. I didn't even bother to taste the crab legs because they were cold. Again I kept my mouth shut for the sake of shielding a black business in front of others. Finally, I ordered a frozen mai tai to drink. It might as well have been a mai tai with ice chips. There was nothing frozen about it in the slightest. After 3 minutes on the table, it was all simply liquid. The ice had melted. The reviews were hit or miss and I took the chance because it smelled so good. But honestly I should have called a manager over for all of it. That potato had to be the most egregious of all I mean you can throw a potato in the microwave to soften it up worst case! But it's actually tied with the sauce \"the chef\" simply decided to smother the crab cakes in without asking A) if we want it or B) if someone had allergies... Totally ridiculous. I will never go back.\n",

A.S /food runner The Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges NY.NY ( look this one up!!)and several other places I've done it all!! and was a trainer most places! now on to the review.Sat July 18th 2020 8:45pmmy first impression was good nice set up looked nice and clean. employee appearance was good to great. i remember a few years back asking myself why don't they have a lounge here. and finally there is one lets see after covid how the place will change don't think the out side seating will exist. (unless the owner is willing to pay for the permit $$$). i do have to agree that the music was to loud would make conversation a challenge. i ordered the crab cakes over cooked which will make them dry presentation looked pleasant. 2nd order wings. over cooked and rubbery ( i have a few theories).  3rd order cheese Burger! cause i was not asked figured id make sure it was not well done lol to please make closer to medium well lol finally fries were great and burger was delicious! i remember the Dj announcing welcome to code red something \"fine dinning\".  with that in mind as a mental note. before i left went to the bathroom for a closer look. glancing at the kitchen set me up for a disappointment. the kitchen is not set up for fine dinning abilities. kitchen not set up for full-service. bill: gratuity was included $21.** i gave an extra $10 in cash. server has potential final impression:I am so happy code red found a way to operate and provide a serve and jobs in the community at a most vital and needed time. Guys were enjoying themselves to drinks and music females dressed to impressed. taking selfies for IG . prices - i would compare with Applebee's (not happy hour prices).  the out door seating while temporary would return for a drink or two and the burger for sure!  moving forward. with out the out door seating would run inside for a burger if I am in the neighborhood.Code Red while needs to improve on some food quality i wouldn't dismiss them totally. tip ask a friend have you tried this before you order. order what they've tried and liked before you take a gamble. Good place and hopefully a stepping stone for future eateries in a neighborhood ripe for the experience.Good luck Code Red and many blessings and prosperity thank you\n",

      "Once upon a time , I used to rally enjoy this restaurant but afyer my experience last week, NEVER again. First and foremost, how does take out food ordered in person take 1 hour and a half to make? You would think I ordered something sensational. Literally, ordered a chicken rasta pasta , calamari, jerk pork with rice and peas, side of macaroni and cheese and two rum punches. The food was disgusting and so were the drinks. after complaining about the wait time and the drinks watered downs , the manager tried to ease my frustrations with one free replacement drink as I expressed the drinks were made way before the food was done. One of the workers tried to justify and say \" just stir its good Jamaican rum wont be watery\"....ummm so ice just remains solid Huh? The Rasta pasta had no flavor and it tasted like spicy milk, the amount of calamari wasn't worth the price,, the jerk pork had too much fat on it and the mac and cheese was not BAKED!!! looked like oven top mac and cheese placed in a container. I will not support his business!! oh and the rum punch tasted more like ginger punch.\n",

Not a fan of the chunks they used but the ackee was good. I also purchased the rum (black cake). I hate black cake just to inform you. Theirs is beyond amazing.

      "The atmosphere, food, service, and drinks are top notch. My food arrived piping hot, even though I was with a group. In my book that's 3 thumbs up. As a certified oxtail and rice and peas aficionado, I can honestly say Code Red is the best I've tasted (my entire family is Jamaican and includes fantastic cooks). It's perfectly seasoned, the gravy is rich, thick, and dark making it a heavenly accompaniment to the delectable rice and peas. The rum punch is DIVINE, the hint of clove is unique & scrumptious.Make your way to a Code Red ASAP, you'll be glad you did. You can thank me with a plate of oxtail!\n",

      "I decided to go to code red today with a few of my friends....Let's just say it was my first and last time going back.... I had the burger with fries.... the meat had a nasty  flavor and the burger was dry. The French fries were soggy and hardly had flavor....  I also had the $5 rum punch which was ok to say the least.  So I was in the mood for a margarita (which is my favorite drink)  I had the passion fruit margarita.... it was the worst margarita I have ever had so I decided to return it... this posed as a issue because apparently I have to pay for it... so the bartender decided to add more sour mix and liquor.... it was still not good....so I demanded that they take it because at this point I'm disappointed and just wanted to leave.... As the manager was explaining to the Bartender about the drink she appeared to have a problem because she was responding in an argumentative manner and presumed to look at me negatively as I left the restaurant. The owner also had a negative reaction once informed about the drink also.   Moral of the story Code Red will never see my face again.... They know nothing about customer service and it's a pity that they did not know that they were dealing with a food service critic...\n",

I give 5 stars alone for that. Sorry to say but most carribean establishments the staff is rude. The bartenders always smile, make eye contact and make sure you're happy with your drink. When you go please try the \"Code Red Pasta\" and their Rum Punch you won't be disappointed.\n",

Who wants to eat a meal with blaring music in your ear?  It took half an hour for a pina colada to be delivered to our table. When I asked the waitress about the wait time she nonchalantly told me to just wait while the bartender was just standing around running his mouth. The food was gross. I ordered orange glazed salmon which was horrible-no seasoning. I guess they thought the glaze was supposed to give it flavor. The rice and peas tasted like cardboard.  I will never ever go here again.  Note to owner: work on your customer service and Definitely hire a new chef!! If I could give zero stars I would.\n",

One of the waitresses was super sweet with my son & enjoyed talking with him from time to time while we waited for the food. The burger was so tender & the fries were seasoned well. My son's chicken tenders were seasoned well, although I think the only downside is that it was a tad bit rubbery. Overall, it was still a great experience & I'd totally come visit again (without my son next time cause he kinda gave me a rough time)\n",
